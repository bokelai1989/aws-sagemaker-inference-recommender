    "With an 'Advanced' job, you can provide your production requirements, select instance types, tune environment variables and perform more extensive load tests. This typically takes 2 hours depending on your traffic pattern and number of instance types.\n",

    "The output is a list of endpoint configuration recommendations (instance type, instance count, environment variables) with associated cost, throughput and latency metrics.\n",

    "In the below example, we are tuning the endpoint against an environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS with values [1, 2, 4] and we aim to limit the latency requirement to 500 ms. The goal is to find which value for OMP_NUM_THREADS provides the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some context, Python internally uses OpenMP for implementing multithreading within processes. The default value for OMP_NUM_THREADS is equal to the number of CPU core. However, when implemented on top of Simultaneous Multi Threading (SMT) such Intel’s HypeThreading, a certain process might oversubscribe a particular core by spawning twice the threads as the number of actual CPU cores. In certain cases, a Python binary might end up spawning up to four times the threads as available actual processor cores. Therefore, an ideal setting for this parameter, if you have oversubscribed available cores using worker threads, is 1 or half the number of CPU cores on a SMT-enabled CPU."
